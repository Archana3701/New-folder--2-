            Jobs was born in San Francisco in 1955 and adopted shortly afterwards. He attended Reed College in 1972
            before
            withdrawing that same year. In 1974, he traveled through India, seeking enlightenment before later studying
            Zen
            Buddhism. He and Wozniak co-founded Apple in 1976 to further develop and sell Wozniak's Apple I personal
            computer.
